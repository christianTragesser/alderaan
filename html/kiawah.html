<p class="item">What happened next was very wierd.  I asked her if she knew anyone at the restaurant and she took me to two guys that were standing around drinking at the other end.  I dont really remember too much of the guys other than they just told me that they had just met her about two hours ago.  We decided to go get drinks at another place called Wild Wing, er something like that.  After not even being in the place for like 15 minutes I decide to get a round of drinks.  Then immediately after giving our birthday girl a drink - I get grabbed by the arm and escorted out of the bar.  I know what you are thinkng and NO we weren't performing the same manuvers as illustrated in the previous photos.  I've been thinking about it and I think that the guys that were "Sara's friends" pulled the ultimate Co** Block telling the bouncer some shit to get me escorted out. This is where the night took a turn for the worse.  After being kicked out I was pulled over by the cops, got lost, and my wallet ended up being lost by the next morning (which is still lost).  Obviously someone must pay.  The only one who I can think of is Sara.  So Ive decided to open a hotline that anyone can call to let me know just how much you enjoy Sara's pics.  Just call: (443) 807-6147 You can leave a message. Sara may answer herself!  Let her
know what a good job she did.
