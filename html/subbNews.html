<h1>Season 2</h1>
<h4>January 18th, 2006</h4><br>
Yes we are still here.  What can I say life can be hectic at times.  The Magpies are playing with new bases this year and they have already proven better. Our record so far: 1-2-0.  Also huge props for Jeff of the Ofallon Flames for providing me with a phat <a href="/images/subb/soulard_logo.jpg" target="_blank">new logo</a>.  I plan to redesign this site also I just need the uh, time.

<h1>Season 1</h1>
<h4>Feburary 21st, 2005</h4><br>
<p class="date">Many thanks for the Southern Division stopping by.  The lack of practice and 'conditioning' was prevelant this week as the Magpies got beat by every team in the southern division and Florissant United.  When Christian was asked about his job being in danger as manager of the Lami Hill crew, the firey chap replied, "Lay off, Ive been traveling alot and have jet lag!"  Luckly Shaw United and Central werent able to attend so the "beat by every team in the league in one day" title still hasnt been achieved.
