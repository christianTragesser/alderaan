<class="date">Have you ever seen the TV camera during NFL games that seems to literally float a few feet above the heads of players on the field?  I've often wondered <a href="http://evoen.net/images/NFLcam.jpg" target="_blank">how they get such cool video</a> of the game.  The whole system is operated by a Linux distro called RTLinux.

Regardless, when women having babies 'out of the blue' becomes a common situation, I would tend to think obesity is a certified epidemic.

<class="date">Happy Halloween.  Since the 9/11/01 attacks on the nation's airline companies there has been a hike in prices known as the 9/11 fee applied to each ticket purchase.  Where does that money go?  Well here in St. Louis <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/45F35EDA9D266A51862572180013F168?OpenDocument" target="_blank">$160k of the spent tax money is being put in storage</a> because airport officials have deemed it an eyesore and cant agree on where to put it.  Dont you typically spend $160k on equipment you need and already have a plan for? The knee is getting better.  Congrats Cards.<br>

I will glady forfeit two losing seasons to have that cancer removed from our game.

<class="date">Every summer there are at least 10 consecutive days where it is 93 degrees or hotter here in St. Louis.  Hitting 100 is pretty hot but is not unheard of.  The last phrase I would use to describe the current heat wave that has hit most of the nation is "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WEATHER/07/18/heatwave.ap/index.html" target="_blank">Insanity. Insanity!</a>"  I bet things wouldve sucked 300% more if you lived before air conditioning, refrigeration, or electricity became such a standard in our society.  I cant imagine today's temperature(currently 96), living in a home made of sticks and buffalo skin, sweating my ass off in 85% humidity, and knowing that if I wanted something to eat for lunch Id have to run around in the heat and kill it.  These hot days were much better when all I had to do was go swimming each day but  I will take this anytime over walking to work in pain because my ears, nose, and fingers are frostbitten.  You are spoiled, I am not insane.

<class="date">I have no pics from Fair Saint Louis this year because it sucked. They didnt even have an air show for this year.  It was only two days(Saturday and Tuesday) and practically every vital street in the city has construction work on it. I drove a few blocks down the street tonight to watch the fireworks because they are usually the best in the area.  Man I dont know about this year. Maybe it had something to do with the rain but a lot was left to be desired.  I guess this was a statement year for the Fair St. Louis organization that they will need money from the public for a much better fair.  Anyway, happy 4th of July.

<p class="date">In 1995 I saw a movie called "Hackers" and instantly fell in love with Kate Libby(Acid Burn) who is now so well known as Angelina Jolie.  How could you not be in love with this <a href="/images/angelina.jpg" target="_blank">girl</a>?  The short hair, almond green eyes, and a set of lips that just made you wanna....... Anyway, back then(were talking pre-Gia) she was w/o a doubt my first wish when asked, "What would you ask for if you had three wishes?"  Now, she makes me want to puke.  Why? Ive had enough.  First there was the kissing her brother on TV thing. Eh, that was ok cause shes hot and I had a thing for troubled girls.  Then there was the whole Billy Bob-tattoo-blood in a vial deal which really I didnt mind cause it was original but never understood it being with Billy Bob.  Now, there is this new story reporting that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/19/people.jolie.pitt.ap/index.html">Angelina's children can now take Brad Pitt's lastname</a>.  WTF?  Sweetheart, he hasnt even been divorced for a year.  How are you going to give your children his last name when youre not even married to him?  This isnt a tattoo you can have removed or filled in - these are human lives you are now fucking up. Brad, c'mon dude.  It cant be THAT good(you lucky bastard).

Before gutting the place John stumbled apoun a back room with the walls covered in event posters and memorabilia.  He was able to snag me <a href="http://evoen.net/images/feelgoodPoster.jpg" target="_blank">a poster</a> of an event which I attended and was also signed by the much liked Charles Feelgood.

I just have to find the most economical/feasable way of finding a new system for him and he will live on a la 'Ghost in the Shell'. I suppose I now have motivation to get my taxes done.

<p class="date">I saw <a href="http://www.ksdk.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=69597" target="_blank">this</a> story on the news lastnight and was astonished.  First that these people have the IQ of a stick and have made it into their 80's. Second, the luck that these people have.  For those of you not familiar with the St. Louis Metropolitain area (and those of you who think that the world ends at Sauget, Ill) there are many MANY places you can get lost between Maryland Heights and East St. Louis(which have to be atleast 40 minutes AND ONE RIVER away from each other).  You have to watch the video on this story to appreciate how funny this is.  Things that blow my mind - they were totally in the wrong state, they wouldnt stop for directions after being lost for 24 hours (not to mention driving around for that long) and after getting gas 3 times! Can anyone think of a better case to support an age limit on driving?  Amazingly no cars were side swiped with an 80+ year old behind the wheel for more than 30 minutes.

<p class="date">A venue with good electronic music here in St. Louis is few and far between these days.  Parties used to be pretty cool and worth the hassle of the authorities to see and hear people spin music from all over the world.  You didnt get the watered down plasic shit that you get now on Washington (Z-107.7 is live from Velvet now for Christ's sake) and certainly the DJ's were much more humble.  Anyway, come listen to some good <a href="http://www.di.fm/edmguide/music.swf" target="_blank">techno</a>(not the generic word for dance music) where my friend Chyle(MasterMind) will be spinning along with others at the Kastle.

I have been to a lot of places in St. louis however there is no other place better go than the city museum.  They have a massive playground that is convienently placed right next to a bar.

I've debated whether or not to put this up but have decided that <a href="http://www.jnchosting.com/iraq2vediom.wmv" target="_blank">it</a> should be seen.  Not for the gory aspect of entertainment or acceptance from an audience but merely to reflect the mind frame of the people who hate anything to do with America.  You cannot reason with people like this. They cant conceive compromise. Life or death is what they understand.  If you are an American please wake up and realize that your mere presence in their countries is enough for them to want to kill you. Americans cannot help these people. This is the lesson we learn from a man in his twenties who merely worked in the communications field trying to build a better Iraq.  Somehow we've lost our bearings and are replacing a government while al-Queda flourishes.  What's going on?

<p class="date">The Degobah System has undergone some changes for the better thanks to the charity of other's machines that are no longer being used use.  The Evoen Server (the first server to serve on the Degobah Sytem) has been retired and has been replaced by a "newer" old metrix system provided to me by my workplace.  A media server has also been added for more storage space to be streamed to my xbox.  Speaking of the xbox, it is complete and Im pretty happy with the final outcome.  Final pics will be up soon.  On a 'personal belief' note, I love the city of St. Louis.  The city is in a major transition phase right now and I think that the current powers that be should be praised.  However, more needs to be done to extinguish Rev. Larry Rice's self-proclaimed power here in the downtown area.  It seems that when things don't go his way the people who he 'helps' feel his wrath.  Larry, there is an old saying: "Give a man a fish and he eats for a day.  Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime."  So you lost out on 1,000 more beds for the homeless.  Don't take it out on them for getting some education from another charitable organization.  Quit trying to harbor unproductivenes and start helping to build a better St. Louis.

If you took this to a LAN party you could actually charge for campers around your desk.  Make sure you're sitting down if you decide to watch the video clip.  My xbox has my Xecuter 2.3 Lite + chip in it and is now running the evoX dashboard.
I'm going to put a bigger HD in and then it will be finished.  I'll post pics when Im done.

<p class="date">I just got my Xecuter lite plus mod chip for my Xbox.  With this chip I'm going to be turning my Xbox in to a media server for the most part.  I'll be able to back up all my games and run them from the harddrive.  Sweeeet. I'm hoping to have it done by the end of the week.  Ill post pictures and maybe even post a 'how to' if anyone is also intrested.

<p class="date">And were back... *sigh* What a weekend.  Let's see where to start?  Well first off Mardi Gras was pretty cool and pics are on the way.  Probably up tomorrow or Friday.  Incase you didn't notice Alderaan was down since Sunday.  Since about 200,000 people came down to celebrate, the cell phone companies put up extra towers and also hung extra power lines.  Sunday they were taking the extra lines down and then the power went out in my apartment complex.  No problem, thats why I have a APC powercell as a back up.  The only thing is I was staying at my mom's on Sunday so I could help her out early Monday for her surgery to remove cancerous tissue(the surgery went great, and she is recovering very well).  So through out the day R2-D2 and evoen were running on a APC UPS.  I wonder how long that lasted.  When I get home the power is on and I try to tend to evoen.  On boot up I get 'login @localhost'.  Localhost? It should be 'evoen'.  Somehow pretty much all my settings were erased and the machine just doesn't know who it is or what it does.  So I had to re-install the OS and set up the server all over again.  Moral of the story?  Back up your data boys and girls.

<p class="date">Mardi Gras crazyness starts tomorrow. *gulp*  I approach this day with great caution.  Im going to try to get some pictures from Saturdays parade up here.  Living a block from the parade route should give me some good content.

<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/02/04/swearing.suspension.ap/index.html" target="_top">"you're gonna go to hell"</a> from some kid while standing in line at school?  I think someone was having a bad day and took it out on little Brandy.
