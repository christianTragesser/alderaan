The beautiful and historic neighborhood of Soulard is the home to one of the latest additions to the St. Louis Subbuteo League.  There was such a great cry for subbuteo represenation in the downtown and southern parts of the city that the SSC was born.  Fortunately Shaw United's manager, Michael Keller, was able to assist the Magpies in the construction of their new home just in time for the 2004 season.  After the purchase of the new stadium, it was lifted to a towing rig(ok, it was put in my car) and brought to its historic home.  The field's cosmetics were then applied to personalize its dimensions.
