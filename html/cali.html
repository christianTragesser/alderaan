<h1>My trip to California</h1>
<hr no shade>
<br>
<p>So this was my third trip this summer.  My cousin Tim got married in Monterey, CA and since this was my first trip out to California I wanted to see as much of northern California as I could.  We flew into San Jose and made the trek up to San Francisco and then toured certain locations through out Silicon Valley. Next we traveled through a forest of Redwoods and made the trip to Monterey via California HWY 1.  California is everything(climate and country wise) that you hear about in media.  My only regret is that I didnt have more time in these areas.  I broke the pics up into 3 different pages to save on load time.
